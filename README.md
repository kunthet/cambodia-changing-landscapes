# Cambodia Changing Landscapes

Visit https://cambodia-changing-landscapes.com to view the blog.

Welcome to a visual journal of the places where Cambodia's forests, rivers, and construction sites intersect. This blog is built from thousands of photographs captured on real project visits from mountain quarries and gravel pits to mangrove edges and river dredging operations. Each post pairs those field images with on-the-ground observations to tell honest stories about a nation in motion.

## What You'll Discover

- **Forests & Mountains**  Quiet, reflective photo essays documenting disappearing hillsides, new roads, and the wild spaces that still breathe.
- **Rivers & Waterways**  Sand mining, floodplains, and communities living with shifting currents.
- **Gravel & Industry**  Machinery, logistics, and the human effort powering Cambodia's infrastructure boom.
- **People & Local Life**  Portraits and moments that show how development touches workers, families, and villages.
- **Reflections & Stories**  Thoughtful mini-essays that blend memory, sensory detail, and lessons from the field.
- **Environmental Notes**  Accessible explainers on erosion, sediment, and what long-term change looks like up close.

## Why It Matters

- **Authentic field data** Each story begins with time-stamped, geo-referenced photos collected on site, not stock imagery.
- **Change over time** Before-and-after perspectives reveal how landscapes evolve under pressure.
- **Local insight** Personal observations translate industrial progress into human-scale narratives.
- **Open conversation** The goal is not to judge, but to witness and document development with clarity and respect.
